## 1 General Information

**Darwin Core** is a standard for describing biodiversity data. It has a focus on taxa and their occurences in nature. If your data shares this focus, it would be great if you could map your data to Darwin Core terms. You have never heard of Darwin Core before? Or you don`t know anything about mappings? Don`t worry, I will show you, how to do this step by step.
