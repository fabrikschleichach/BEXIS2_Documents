## 1 General Information

*BETA-FOR Data* is the general Data Platform of BETA-FOR. All data created within BETA-FOR should have a Dataset in *BETA-FOR Data*. 

In BEXIS2, data is stored and managed as part of a **Dataset**. You can think of a Dataset as a container for the (primary) data on the one hand, and the metadata on the other.

* **Metadata**: describing facts about the dataset, e.g. who created the dataset and when
* **(Primary) Data**: can be files or tabular data
* **File**: unstructured data, e.g. an audio file or image
* **Tabular Data**: structured data; supported formats are Excel and ASCII
* **Data Structure**: describes the structure of the data

Big raw data cannot be stored in *BETA-FOR Data* directly. Upload it to ... and include a reference to the exact storage location in the ![metadata](https://github.com/fabrikschleichach/BEXIS2_Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Upload%20Data/Manual.md#38-alternate-identifiers).
